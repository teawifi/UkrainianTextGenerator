# UkrainianTextGenerator
 The Ukrainian text generator is written using Keras (TensorFlaw backend) - Functional API model. Input texts are cleaned and analyzed, tagged using the LanguageTool API NLP UK (https://github.com/brown-uk/nlp_uk). The language model based LSTM takes a sequence of words. Each word is described by a pair: its lemma and its grammatical meaning. The pretrained word embedding model - Word2Vec (ubercorpus.lowercased.lemmatized.word2vec.300d) from lang-uk group (http://lang.org.ua/uk/models/) is using for the vector representation of lemma. Grammatical value is binary vector. The model was trained on corpus of Ukrainian fiction.
